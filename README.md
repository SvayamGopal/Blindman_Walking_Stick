# Blindman Walking Stick
Blindness is a more severe problem among other disabilities of human beings. Since a blind person cannot precisely feel their surroundings like a normal person, they might often require some sort of aid to perform various tasks, travelling being one of them. Researchers and developers invented several devices to achieve independent navigation for the blind. But most of these inventions are for a specific task or are usually not cost effective. To facilitate independent navigation, a device with more features is required. For this purpose, “Walking stick for the blind” has been designed to fulfill the goal. The device eliminates the requirement of human assistance for blind while traveling outdoors. It is made from reliable parts and features a relatively low cost compared to industrial bots. Every part of the device is simulated and tested. The device can be operated by any operator and requires low power. Arduino Mega (ATMega2560) has been used as the processor, ultrasonic sensors have been used to detect obstacles (at a distance both horizontally and depth wise), IR sensors have been used to detect lines. Two dc motors are joined using a full bridge motor driver L98 module to navigate. A buzzer and a vibration motor is used to give notification to the user.
